the code blocks that were there in the lectures are currently just written as text depicting what is supposed to be in those notebooks. I am not a big fan of Julia, so will be converting the notebooks to python, only using NumPy/torch, for maximum learning. I am open to PRs if anyone is interested to help me out to make the notes less reliant on the Julia notebooks.
 
Also I have done my best for these to be factually correct, so if you spot any mistakes, PRs are welcome.
